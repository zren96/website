== About Me
I was born in Jiangsu, China and grew up there until 16 when I continued high school in the U.S.. I can speak Mandarin, English, and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Chinese Wu] fluently. I enjoy watching and playing soccer, hitting the gym, and traveling/backpacking. I am also getting a private pilot license.
